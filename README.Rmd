## Markdown vs. R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown uses the Markdown language, but allows for the addition of authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents with functional code snippets and actual outputs from within the RStudio IDE.

* For RStudio see <https://rstudio.com/>.
* For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Converting from `README.Rmd` → `README.md`

You can clone this repository as a template for your own feature-rich `README.md` files on GitHub.

If you open the `README.Rmd` document for editing in RStudio and click the **Knit** button, a normal Markdown document (`README.md`) will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Code and output

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r chunk_id_cars}
summary(cars)
```

> `cars` is one of many default example data sets in the R language.

## Images

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r chunk_id_pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

> The output image from this code execution will be automatically saved in the `.img` subdirectory.

The following is an intermediate tutorial on data handling, manipulation, processing, and reporting.

An introduction to the R language can be found here: [Introduction to Programming (in R)](https://github.com/atet/learn/blob/master/programming/README.md#atet--learn--programming)

### Prerequisites

* R language and RStudio installed locally in your development environment: [Instructions](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Clone this `tutorial` branch, e.g. in CLI:

```console
$ git clone --branch tutorial git@github.com:atet/rmd.git
```

* Install required R packages for R Markdown support (only needs to be done once) and load them (needs to be done per session):

```r
> install.packages("knitr"); install.packages("rmarkdown"); library(knitr); library("rmarkdown")
```

* Ensure that your working directory is at the root of this repository, otherwise set it using the absolute file path:
   * You can use forward slash ('`/`') or escaped backslashes ('`\\`') for Windows file paths

```r
> getwd()
[1] "<INCORRECT_FILE_PATH>"
> setwd("<CORRECT_FILE_PATH>")
```

### Background

Everything in your R environment is an object that is stored in-memory, i.e. you can work with as large of a data set as you have RAM (_and swap_) on your development machine.

You can quickly find information about a function by executing a '`?`' in front of the function name:

```r
> ?set.seed
```

### Loading Data

Data can be loaded directly from disk using absolute or relative paths to current working directory:

```{r chunk_id_load1}
iris1 = read.csv("./dat/iris1.csv")
iris2 = read.csv("./dat/iris2.csv")
```

..or directly from a URL:

```{r chunk_id_load2}
iris3 = read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atet/rmd/tutorial/dat/iris3.csv"))
iris4 = read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atet/rmd/tutorial/dat/iris4.csv"))
```

### Metadata

Printing out basic object class information and number of row and columns:

```{r chunk_id_metadata1}
cat("The `iris1` object is of \"", class(iris1),"\" class and has ", nrow(iris1), " rows/", ncol(iris1), " columns.", sep = "")
```

..or a summary of the object's structure:

```{r chunk_id_metadata2}
str(iris1)
```

..or a summary of the object's data:

```{r chunk_id_metadata3}
summary(iris1)
```

..or column and row names (row names typically character numbers by default): 

```{r chunk_id_metadata4}
colnames(iris1)
rownames(iris1)
```

### Subsetting

The `*.csv` files loaded are of object class `data.frame` in the current environment. These as simple two-dimensional, tabular data sets like an Excel spreadsheet with rows and columns.

You can reference an entire column from the `data.frame` as a vector by using the '`$`' symbol:

```{r chunk_id_subsetting1}
iris1$id
```

..or subset rows by specifying conditions before the comma in the square brackets below:

```{r chunk_id_subsetting2}
iris1[1, ]
iris1[2:3, ]
iris1[iris1$id == 4, ]
```

..or subset columns by specifying conditions after the comma in the square brackets below (also subsetting rows to limit output):

> NOTE: If you subset a single column from a `data.frame`, it could be returned as a vector in most cases.

```{r chunk_id_subsetting3}
iris1[1:5, 1:2]
iris1[1:5, c("Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length")]
iris1[1:5, colnames(iris1) == "Petal.Width"]
```

### Manipulation

The four data sets loaded were previously split from a larger data set, we will merge them all back together.

You can concatenate rows of data together:

```{r chunk_id_manipulation1}
iris12 = rbind(iris1, iris2)
iris34 = rbind(iris3, iris4)
```

Though you could also concatenate columns together, we will merge using a key row `$id` to ensure that out-of-order data is merged correctly:

```{r chunk_id_manipulation2}
iris1234 = merge(iris12, iris34, by = "id")
str(iris1234)
```

### Summarization

Earlier we used the `summary()` function to quickly get information on all data in a `data.frame`:

```{r chunk_id_summarize1`}
summary(iris1234)
```

You can calculate the same information but for specific columns of data:

```{r chunk_id_summarize2`}
min(iris1234$Sepal.Length)
quantile(iris1234$Sepal.Length, prob = 0.25)
median(iris1234$Sepal.Length)
mean(iris1234$Sepal.Length)
quantile(iris1234$Sepal.Length, prob = 0.75)
max(iris1234$Sepal.Length)
```

Additionally, you can get other descriptive statistics like variance and standard deviation:

```{r chunk_id_summarize3`}
var(iris1234$Sepal.Length)
sd(iris1234$Sepal.Length)
```

..or all percentile bins (e.g. 25% increments):

```{r chunk_id_summarize4`}
quantile(iris1234$Sepal.Length, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
quantile(iris1234$Sepal.Length, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25))
```

..or tabulating counts of unique values:

```{r chunk_id_summarize5`}
table(iris1234$Species)
```

..or binning values then tabulating the bins:

```{r chunk_id_summarize6`}
table(cut(iris1234$Sepal.Length, breaks = c(0, 4, 5, 6, 7, Inf)))
```

### Visualization

Data can be quickly visualized for sanity checks or highly polished for publication quality figures. The following are a few popular and basic visualizations.

> NOTE: Visualizations can be saved through the RStudio GUI or programmatically (not shown)

#### One-Dimensional Data: Single Histogram

```{r chunk_id_histogram}
hist(iris1234$Sepal.Length)
```

#### One-Dimensional Data: Single Density Plot

```{r chunk_id_density}
plot(density(iris1234$Sepal.Length))
```

#### One-Dimensional Data: Comparative Boxplots

> NOTE: The tilde '`~`' below is basically saying "..where Sepal.Length _depends_ on Species"

```{r chunk_id_boxplot}
boxplot(iris1234$Sepal.Length ~ iris1234$Species)
```

#### Two-Dimensional Data: Single Scatterplot

```{r chunk_id_scatterplot1}
plot(iris1234$Sepal.Length, iris1234$Sepal.Width)
```

#### Two-Dimensional Data: Comparative Scatterplot

```{r chunk_id_scatterplot2}
# Default, all points are black
plot(iris1234$Sepal.Length, iris1234$Sepal.Width)
# Subset out Setosa and add blue points
points(iris1234[iris1234$Species == "setosa",]$Sepal.Length, iris1234[iris1234$Species == "setosa",]$Sepal.Width, col = "blue")
# Subset out Versicolor and red points
points(iris1234[iris1234$Species == "versicolor",]$Sepal.Length, iris1234[iris1234$Species == "versicolor",]$Sepal.Width, col = "red")
```

### Output

The `data.frame` objects can be saved back to disk as a `*.csv` (or any other delimiter):

```r
write.csv(iris1234, "./dat/iris1234.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

..or as an `*.rds` R object (default is compressed).

```r
saveRDS(iris1234, "./dat/iris1234.rds", compress = TRUE)
```

### Protips

The R language works natively on vectors, therefore there are large performance gains leveraging this functionality compared to looping over data structures:

```{r chunk_id_speedtest1}
set.seed(1)
vc = rnorm(100000000)
system.time({
  result1 = 0
  for(i in 1:length(vc)){
    result1 = result1 + vc[i]
  }
})[3]
```
```{r chunk_id_speedtest2}
system.time({
  result2 = sum(vc)
})[3]
all.equal(result1, result2)
```
